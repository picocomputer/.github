The Picocomputer explores retro computing and game development by removing the barrier between genuine 8-bit hardware and modern devices. It can be built entirely with through-hole components, compactly using surface mount devices, or even on a breadboard. No programming devices need to be purchased and the only component used that wasn't available in the 1980s is the $4/â‚¬4 Raspberry Pi Pico.

Access to the reference design and source code is by invitation or by sponsoring

I'm building a YouTube channel to fund projects like this.
I'll make the reference design public with an open source license
once that is monitized, I've bought all the video production equipment I want,
and paid for the equipment I've already bought.
Projections put that well into 2024.
