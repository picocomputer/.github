Here is the [schematic](https://github.com/picocomputer/.github/blob/main/schematic.pdf).

The Picocomputer explores retro computing and game development by removing the barrier between genuine 8-bit hardware and modern devices. It can be built entirely with through-hole components, compactly using surface mount devices, or even on a breadboard. No programming devices need to be purchased and the only component used that wasn't available in the 1980s is the $4/â‚¬4 Raspberry Pi Pico.

I'm building a YouTube channel to fund projects like this.
I'll make everything public with an open source license
once that is monitized and I have all the video production
I want. Projections put that well into 2024.
